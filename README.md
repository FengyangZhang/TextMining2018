Global Vectors for Word Representation (GloVe) is a new global log-bilinear regression model that trains only on the nonzero elements in a word-word co-occurrence matrix, it produces a vector space with meaningful substructure and outperforms related models on similarity and analogy tasks. In this paper we investigate its use in music recommendation system. First we propose a way to use GloVe on songs instead of on words to learn vector embeddings of them, then we introduce our method to do recommendation based on the learned vectors. As a result, we show our model generates useful and meaningful embeddings for songs that can be applied to recommendation and many other tasks like similarity and categorization
